# MIDI Parser

**Ruby Parser for Raw MIDI Messages**

This library is part of a suite of Ruby libraries for MIDI:

| Function | Library |
| --- | --- |
| MIDI Events representation | [MIDI Events](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-events) |
| MIDI Data parsing | [MIDI Parser](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-parser) |
| MIDI communication with Instruments and Control Surfaces | [MIDI Communications](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-communications) |
| Low level MIDI interface to MacOS | [MIDI Communications MacOS Layer](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-communications-macos) |
| Low level MIDI interface to Linux | **TO DO** | 
| Low level MIDI interface to JRuby | **TO DO** | 
| Low level MIDI interface to Windows | **TO DO** | 

This library is based on [Ari Russo's](http://github.com/arirusso) library [Nibbler](https://github.com/arirusso/nibbler).

## Install

`gem install midi-parser`

or using Bundler, add this to your Gemfile

`gem "midi-parser"`

## Usage

```ruby
require 'midi-parser'

midi_parser = MIDIParser.new
```

Enter a message piece by piece:

```ruby
midi_parser.parse("90")
  => nil

midi_parser.parse("40")
  => nil

midi_parser.parse("40")
  => #<MIDIEvents::NoteOn:0x98c9818
       @channel=0,
       @data=[64, 100],
       @name="C3",
       @note=64,
       @status=[9, 0],
       @velocity=100,
       @verbose_name="Note On: C3">
```

Enter a message all at once:

```ruby
midi_parser.parse("904040")

  => #<MIDIEvents::NoteOn:0x98c9818
        @channel=0,
        @data=[64, 100],
        @name="C3",
        @note=64,
        @status=[9, 0],
        @velocity=100,
        @verbose_name="Note On: C3">
```

Use bytes:

```ruby
midi_parser.parse(0x90, 0x40, 0x40)
  => #<MIDIEvents::NoteOn:0x98c9818 ...>
```

You can use nibbles in string format:

```ruby
midi_parser.parse("9", "0", "4", "0", "4", "0")
  => #<MIDIEvents::NoteOn:0x98c9818 ...>
```

Interchange the different types:

```ruby
midi_parser.parse("9", "0", 0x40, 64)
  => #<MIDIEvents::NoteOn:0x98c9818 ...>
```

Use running status:

```ruby
midi_parser.parse(0x40, 64)
  => #<MIDIMEvents::NoteOn:0x98c9818 ...>
```

Add an incomplete message:

```ruby
midi_parser.parse("9")
midi_parser.parse("40")
```

See progress:

```ruby
midi_parser.buffer
  => ["9", "4", "0"]

midi_parser.buffer_s
  => "940"
```

MIDI Parser generates [midi-events](http://github.com/javier-sy/midi-events) objects.

## Differences between [MIDI Parser](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-parser) and [Nibbler](https://github.com/arirusso/nibbler)
[MIDI Parser](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-parser) is mostly a clone of [Nibbler](https://github.com/arirusso/nibbler) with some modifications:
* Removed logging attributes (messages, rejected, processed) to reduce parsing overhead 
* Updated dependencies versions
* Source updated to Ruby 2.7 code conventions (method keyword parameters instead of options = {}, hash keys as 'key:' instead of ':key =>', etc.)
* Changed backend library midi-message to midi-events
* Removed backend library MIDIlib
* Renamed module to MIDIParser instead of Nibbler
* Renamed gem to midi-parser instead of nibbler
* Minor docs fixing 
* TODO: update tests to use rspec instead of rake
* TODO: migrate to (or confirm it's working ok on) Ruby 3.0 or Ruby 3.1

## Then, why does exist this library if it is mostly a clone of another library?

The author has been developing since 2016 a Ruby project called
[Musa DSL](https://github.com/javier-sy/musa-dsl) that needs a way
of representing MIDI Events and a way of communicating with
MIDI Instruments and MIDI Control Surfaces.

[Ari Russo](https://github.com/arirusso) has done a great job creating
several interdependent Ruby libraries that allow
MIDI Events representation ([MIDI Message](https://github.com/arirusso/midi-message)
and [Nibbler](https://github.com/arirusso/nibbler))
and communication with MIDI Instruments and MIDI Control Surfaces
([unimidi](https://github.com/arirusso/unimidi),
[ffi-coremidi](https://github.com/arirusso/ffi-coremidi) and others)
that, **with some modifications**, I've been using in MusaDSL.

After thinking about the best approach to publish MusaDSL
I've decided to publish my own renamed version of the modified dependencies because:

* Some differences on the approach of the modifications vs the original library doesn't allow to merge the modifications on the original libraries.
* Then the renaming of the libraries is needed to avoid confusing existent users of the original libraries.
* Due to some of the interdependencies of Ari Russo libraries,
  the modification and renaming on some of the low level libraries (ffi-coremidi, etc.)
  forces to modify and rename unimidi library.
* The original libraries have features
  (very detailed logging and processing history information, not locking behaviour when waiting input midi messages)
  that are not needed in MusaDSL and, in fact,
  can degrade the performance on some use case scenarios in MusaDSL.

All in all I have decided to publish a suite of libraries optimized for MusaDSL use case that also can be used by other people in their projects.

| Function | Library | Based on Ari Russo's| Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MIDI Events representation | [MIDI Events](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-events) | [MIDI Message](https://github.com/arirusso/midi-message) | removed parsing, small improvements |
| MIDI Data parsing | [MIDI Parser](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-parser) | [Nibbler](https://github.com/arirusso/nibbler) | removed process history information, minor optimizations |
| MIDI communication with Instruments and Control Surfaces | [MIDI Communications](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-communications) | [unimidi](https://github.com/arirusso/unimidi) | use of [MIDI Communications MacOS Layer](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-communications-macos)
| Low level MIDI interface to MacOS | [MIDI Communications MacOS Layer](https://github.com/javier-sy/midi-communications-macos) | [ffi-coremidi](https://github.com/arirusso/ffi-coremidi) | removed process history information, locking behaviour when waiting midi events, improved midi devices name detection, minor optimizations |
| Low level MIDI interface to Linux | **TO DO** | | |
| Low level MIDI interface to JRuby | **TO DO** | | |
| Low level MIDI interface to Windows | **TO DO** | | |
